# IaC to SaC — The Acronym Journey, Because Even Networks Deserve Version Control


## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** defines and manages infrastructure configurations through code, enabling **declarative**, **version-controlled**, and **automated** provisioning of network devices and services.  
It integrates with CI/CD pipelines and commonly uses tools such as **Terraform** for orchestration and programmatic infrastructure management.


## Network as Code (NaC)  

[**Network as Code (NaC)**](https://netascode.cisco.com) extends Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to network configuration and policy management. NaC supports Cisco solutions such as ACI, SD-WAN, Meraki, Nexus Dashboard, and Catalyst Center, ensuring consistent, reliable, and auditable network operations. It provides a single source of truth for configurations, automated deployment pipelines, and integrated testing and observability to guarantee network reliability and compliance.  
## Meraki as Code  

[**Meraki as Code**](https://netascode.cisco.com/docs/data_models/meraki/overview/) is a specialized implementation of Services as Code for Cisco Meraki’s cloud-managed platform.  
It enables **programmatic management** and **automation** of network devices and configurations through the **Meraki API** and **Terraform**.  
This approach supports **declarative infrastructure management** and enables seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines.


## Branch as Code (BaC)   

[**Branch as Code**](https://netascode.cisco.com/docs/guides/branch/00_overview/) automates and manages branch office network infrastructure as code.  
It streamlines deployment and scaling of branch environments using **Terraform** and Cisco’s **validated Unified Branch designs**, ensuring consistency and agility across distributed sites.

## Services as Code (SaC)  

[**Services as Code (SaC)**](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/services/professional/index.html) is a Cisco Lifecycle Services subscription that enables enterprises to define, manage, and operate their network infrastructure and services as software code.  
It applies **DevSecOps** and **automation principles** to network operations, enabling:

- Version control of configurations  
- Automated provisioning, testing, and deployment  
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines  
- Continuous validation and lifecycle management  

By treating network services as code, SaC reduces manual errors, improves change success rates, and accelerates the adoption of new technologies.  

SaC includes:  
- Readiness assessments  
- Enablement of people, processes, and solutions  
- Continuous integration setup  
- Automated deployment and release management  
- 24x7 operational support  

It supports Cisco technologies such as **ACI**, **SD-WAN**, **Nexus Dashboard**, **ISE**, **Catalyst Center**, **Meraki**, and **Unified Branch**.

## Relationship Summary

- **Network as Code (NaC)** is the **foundation**, applying Infrastructure as Code principles to networking.  
- **ACI as Code**, **Meraki as Code**, **VXLAN as Code**, **ISE as Code**, and **Branch as Code** are **specialized implementations** of NaC for specific Cisco technologies.  
- **Services as Code (SaC)** is the Cisco Services Subscription that unifies these implementations into a comprehensive automation and  management methodology—enabling enterprises to manage their entire network and security services ecosystem as code.
